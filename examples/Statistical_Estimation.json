We propose a\nstatistical estimation framework\ndesigned to\nhandle large-scale QA by selectively aggregating\nonly the most informative chunks of text. Our\napproach integrates three key components:\nAdap-\ntive Chunk Sizing\nto dynamically segment docu-\nments based on local content density,\nDynamic\nThresholding\nthat employs Bayesian updates to\n\u0002lter redundant chunks, and a\nCLT-based Statis-\ntical Context Estimation\nmechanism to approxi-\nmate the entire document's embedding. Unlike\ntraditional extractive metrics (EM/F1), we rely\non\ngenerative\nQA metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, Per-\nplexity) to capture both correctness and \u0003uency\nin open-ended responses. Experimental results on\nbenchmarks such as HotpotQA, TriviaQA, and\nNatural Questions demonstrate that our method\nnot only reduces computational overhead but also\nimproves generative QA quality over baselines\n(e.g., FiD, RAG). This highlights how a princi-\npled, yet \u0003exible, statistical perspective can ef-\nfectively overcome context-window constraints in\nmodern LLMs.\n1.

Despite\nthis remarkable progress, these models continue to be con-\nstrained by \u0002nite context windows, often ranging from a few\nthousand to tens of thousands of tokens. While extended\ncontext capabilities (e.g., 32k tokens) provide partial relief,\nreal-world settings such as multi-chapter textbooks, lengthy\nlegal contracts, and intricate medical records can easily ex-\nceed these limits, leaving the model blind to signi\u0002cant\nsegments of text and consequently producing incomplete or\nsuboptimal answers.\nA common solution is to break the source text into smaller\nchunks\nthat individually \u0002t into the model's context window.\nHowever, naive chunking strategies introduce two critical\nissues. First, important details can be dispersed across mul-\ntiple chunks, a phenomeno n we refer to as\ncontext frag-\nmentation\n. This fragmentation undermines the coherence\nnecessary for complex reasoning, as it forces the model to\npiece together widely separated information. Second, the\noverlapping chunks necessary to preserve cross-boundary\ncontext often lead to\nredundancy\n, bloating both the com-\nputational cost and the effective input size presented to the\nmodel. Such redundancy can dilute key information, ulti-\nmately harming the system's overall performance.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a no-\ntable attempt to alleviate these constraints by fetching\nrelevant passages from a large corpus, then fusing them\nwithin a generative transformer. Although RAG and simi-\nlar frameworks (e.g., DPR, Contriever) excel at retrieving\ntopically relevant content, they frequently suffer from an\nover-retrieval of near-duplicate passages, especially for long\nor repetitive source documents. This can induce a form of\nredundancy similar to naive chunking, wherein the model's\neffective input length grows excessively, and the generative\nmodel struggles to identify the most salient facts. Moreover,\nthe retrieval step often relies on static or heuristically tuned\nthresholds that do not dynamically adapt to the inherent\noverlap or novelty among candidate passages.\nIn this paper, we propose a statistical estimation framework\nthat addresses both the chunking problem and certain limi-\ntations of retrieval-augmented QA pipelines. Our approach\nleverages an\nonline Bayesian thresholding\nmechanism to\n\u0002lter out redundant or near-duplicate text segments. In do-\n1\n",

Speci\u0002cally, we model the\nnovelty\nof each chunk\nembedding with a time-varying Gaussian distribution, up-\ndating a posterior estimate\n(\n ˙\n2\n)\nevery time a new chunk\nis processed. If the newly observed novelty score exceeds\n\n+\n\u000b ˙\n, that chunk is considered suf\u0002ciently distinct and\nadded to the \u0002nal prompt; otherwise, it is skipped. By con-\ntinuously re\u0002ning\n(\n ˙\n2\n)\n, the acceptance threshold adapts\nto the evolving content distribution, ensuring that a series of\nhighly similar chunks triggers an increase in the threshold\nand prevents the accumulation of repetitive text.\nOur framework can be deployed on top of either a \u0002xed\nor adaptive chunking procedure. Additionally, it can be\ncombined with external retrieval modules (e.g., Faiss, DPR,\nRAG) to handle multi-document question answering. In\nmulti-document scenarios, we \u0002rst retrieve a small set of\ntop-ranked passages and then apply our Bayesian thresh-\nolding to each retrieved text. As a result, we retain the\nbene\u0002ts of retrieval-augmented generation (focusing on rel-\nevant passages) while avoiding a common pitfall in RAG-\nbased approaches, namely the unbounded accumulation of\noverlapping or near-duplicate segments.\nIn essence, the contribution of this work is threefold. First,\nwe introduce a\nBayesian chunk-\u0002ltering\nmechanism that\ncontinuously adapts its acceptance threshold based on ob-\nserved novelty scores. Second, we provide an integrated\nperspective on\nlong-text chunking and retrieval augmen-\ntation\n, showing how to unify these techniques in a way\nthat \u0002lters out super\u0003uous tokens while preserving the es-\nsential parts of the original context. Third, we present a\ncomprehensive\nempirical evaluation\non QA benchmarks\nlike HotpotQA and TriviaQA. Our results indicate that the\nproposed framework not only curtails computation by dis-\ncarding repetitive chunks but also improves semantic \u0002-\ndelity and generative quality, as measured by metrics such\nas BERTScore and perplexity. When compared to naive\nchunking or RAG alone, our approach more effectively\nleverages long contexts by reducing irrelevant redundancy.\nOverall, this paper highlights how a\nprincipled statistical\nmethodology\ncan address the inherent issues of \u0002nite con-\ntext windows and the tendency of retrieval-based systems\nto repeat content. By judiciously selecting only chunks that\nprovide new information, we sidestep both context frag-\nmentation and exponential growth in input length, allowing\ngenerative QA models to maintain clarity and focus on truly\nsalient information. We proceed by reviewing related litera-\nture on chunking, retrieval augmentation, and large-context\nQA in Section\n 2\n, then detail our Bayesian thresholding\nframework in Section\n 3\n. Section\n 4\n outlines our experimen-\ntal design, including datasets and evaluation metrics, and\nSection\n 5\n presents our empirical \u0002ndings. Finally, Section\n 6\nsummarizes our contributions and discusses avenues for\nfuture research.\n2. Related Work\nThis section surveys three key areas of research pertinent to\nlarge-scale question answering (QA): (1)\nmulti-hop QA and\nlong-context reasoning\n, (2)\nchunking strategies under con-\ntext window constraints\n, and (3)\nprobabilistic approaches\nfor adaptive context selection\n. We then conclude with a brief\ndiscussion on how these lines of work inspire our statistical\nestimation framework.\n2.1. Multi-Hop QA and Long-Context Reasoning\nNumerous QA tasks require synthesizing information that is\ndistributed across multiple paragraphs or even multiple doc-\numents. Datasets such as HotpotQA and TriviaQA (\nYang\net al.\n,\n 2018\n;\n Joshi et al.\n,\n 2017\n) exemplify this\nmulti-hop\nsetting, in which the model must combine evidence from\ndifferent parts of the text to arrive at the \u0002nal answer. Tradi-\ntional methods relied on\nMemory Networks\n(\nWeston et al.\n,\n2015\n), which iteratively retrieve and update internal repre-\nsentations of facts. More recent work introduced hybrid or\nend-to-end frameworks that fuse retrieval with generative\nmodels, such as\nFusion-in-Decoder (FiD)\n(\nIzacard & Grave\n,\n2021\n) and\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n(\nLewis\net al.\n,\n 2020\n). While these methods effectively leverage ex-\nternal knowledge sources or large corpora, they often apply\n\u0002xed top-\nk\nretrieval heuristics or pre-segmented input text.\nConsequently, if the documents are exceptionally long or\nrepetitive, the model may still confront fragmented or re-\ndundant passages, undermining both ef\u0002ciency and answer\ncoherence.\n2.2. Chunking Strategies and Context Window\nConstraints\nBecause most transformer-based QA systems can only pro-\ncess a \u0002nite number of tokens (e.g., 512, 1024, or 2048)\nat a time, a popular solution is to\nchunk\nthe documents.\nEarly approaches employed naive \u0002xed-size splitting, which\nfrequently led to\ncontext fragmentation\n(breaking cohesive\ncontent across chunk boundaries) and\nredundancy\n(increas-\ning overlap to maintain continuity) (\nSukhbaatar et al.\n,\n 2015\n;\n?\n). To remedy this, some works utilize\nsemantic-aware\nchunking\n, aiming to align chunk boundaries with natural\ntopic shifts or paragraph boundaries (\nTose et al.\n,\n 1999\n;\n?\n).\nHowever, purely semantic chunking may remain computa-\ntionally expensive for large corpora and does not necessarily\neliminate redundant overlaps if the underlying text itself is\nrepetitive.\nSeveral authors have proposed\nadaptive chunk sizing\nmeth-\nods that dynamically adjust chunk length according to local\n2\n",
    "page_3": "Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2025\ntextual features such as named entity density, discourse\nmarkers, or domain-speci\u0002c cues (\n??\n). These strategies\noften yield more contextually cohesive segments, albeit at\nthe cost of potentially increased variance in segment sizes.\nEven then, overlapping content can remain a problem, espe-\ncially if certain themes or phrases repeat throughout a long\ndocument.\n2.3. Probabilistic Approaches for Adaptive Context\nSelection\nWhile chunking addresses the raw token limit, additional\nmechanisms are sometimes required to \u0002lter near-duplicate\nor low-utility segments when documents are highly redun-\ndant. Recent QA pipelines have begun to explore threshold-\nbased chunk \u0002ltering (\nLewis et al.\n,\n 2020\n), where embed-\ndings of candidate chunks are compared against a reference\nor running context vector. Yet most of these use \u0002xed or\nmanually tuned thresholds that are insensitive to the dy-\nnamic nature of the text distribution.\nIn contrast,\nBayesian\nmethods offer a principled way to\nadapt thresholds in real time. By modeling chunk novelty or\nsimilarity as a random variable drawn from an evolving dis-\ntribution, one can continuously update the parameters (e.g.,\nmean and variance) based on newly observed data (\nGel-\nman et al.\n,\n 2013\n;\n?\n). This u pdate mechanism allows the\nacceptance (or rejection) criterion to tighten when multiple\nsimilar chunks appear, thereby minimizing repetitive con-\ntent. Conversely, if highly varied or dissimilar chunks arise,\nthe threshold can lower, avoiding an overly stringent \u0002lter\nthat might discard essential information.\n2.4. Toward a Uni\u0002ed Statistical Framework\nAlthough multi-hop retrieval, chunking strategies, and adap-\ntive thresholding each address distinct aspects of the long-\ncontext QA challenge, they are seldom integrated in a single\ncoherent pipeline. Recent retrieval-augmented approaches,\nlike RAG, often reduce large corpora to the top-\nk\nmost\nrelevant passages but do not inherently handle overlap or\nnear-duplication within those passages. Conversely, sophis-\nticated chunking methods ensure that each segment stays\nwithin model limits but can still \u0003ood the system with re-\ndundant tokens if the underlying document is repetitive.\nOur work draws upon all three threads of research. We lever-\nage\nchunk-wise document segmentation\nto respect context\nwindow constraints, combine it with\nBayesian threshold-\ning\nto adaptively \u0002lter out repetitive or semantically similar\nchunks, and demonstrate that this synergy scales eff ectively\nto large and multi-document QA tasks. By unifying these\nideas, we aim to preserve the essential advantages of multi-\nhop retrieval and chunk-based reasoning while mitigating\nthe pitfalls of naive segmentation or static thresholding. This\nstatistical estimation framework\nthus off ers a principled way\nto dyn amically manage context size and redundancy, paving\nthe way for more ef\u0002cient and accurate generative QA on\nlong or complex texts.\n3. Proposed Method\nWe propose a statistical estimation method for large-scale\nquestion answering (QA) that proceeds in three main phases:\n(1) Chunk-wise Document Segmentation\n,\n(2) Bayesian\nThresholding\n, and\n(3) Generative Answer Construction\n.\nUnlike simple chunking or retrieval-only pipelines, our ap-\nproach adaptively discards redundant text segments, produc-\ning a \u0002nal context that is both\nsuccinct\nand\nrepresentative\nof the original document's content. In the subsections that\nfollow, we provide an in-depth description of each com-\nponent and clarify the rationale behind the corresponding\nmathematical models.\n3.1. Chunk-wise Document Segmentation\nLet\nD\nbe a text document composed of\nN\ntokens:\nD\n=\nf\nw\n1\n; w\n2\n; : : : ; w\nN\ng\n:\n(1)\nWhen\nN\nis very large, directly feeding\nD\ninto a genera-\ntive language model can exceed its maximum context size.\nTo address this limitation, we divide\nD\ninto segments (or\nchunks\n) that remain within the model's input limits. Specif-\nically, we \u0002x a maximum chunk size\nM\nand an overlap\nsize\nO\n; in many of our experiments,\n(\nM ; O\n) = (300\n;\n30)\n.\nThen, if\n`\nk\nand\nr\nk\nde\u0002ne the start and end indices of the\nk\n-th chunk, we have\nC\nk\n=\nf\nw\n`\nk\n; w\n`\nk\n+1\n; : : : ; w\nr\nk\ng\n; r\nk\n\n`\nk\n+ 1\n\u0014\nM ;\n(2)\nand the next chunk starts approximately at\nr\nk\n\nO\n+ 1\n.\nThis overlapping scheme preserves continuity across chunk\nboundaries (e.g., when sentences or paragraphs span chunk\nedges).\nEmbedding Each Chunk.\nTo facilitate statistical compar-\nison among chunks, we map each\nC\nk\ninto a\nd\n-dimensional\nvector via a pretrained sentence encoder:\nh\nk\n= Enco de\n\nC\nk\n\u0001\n2\nR\nd\n:\n(3)\nBy doing so, each chunk is represented in a continuous\nspace where\nsimilarity\nor\ndistance\ncan be quanti\u0002ed more\nnaturally than with raw text. We collect these embeddings\nas\nf\nh\n1\n;\nh\n2\n; : : : ;\nh\nK\ng\n.\n3.2. Bayesian Thresholding for Chunk Selection\nAlthough segmenting a document into chunks guarantees\neach segment's length remains feasible, many chunks may\noverlap in content. To avoid repetitiveness, we introduce a\n3\n",

The key idea is to form\nand update a\nrunning context vector\n,\nv\nsel\n, which captures\nthe semantics of all chunks selected so far, and then compare\neach new chunk to this context vector to measure\nnovelty\n.\nNovelty Score.\nLet\nh\nk\nbe the embedding of the\nk\n-th\nchunk. We de\u0002ne its novelty score,\nX\nk\n, relative to the\ncurrent context\nv\nsel\nas\nX\nk\n= 1\n\nh\n>\nk\nv\nsel\nk\nh\nk\nk k\nv\nsel\nk\n+\n\"\n;\n(4)\nwhere\n\"\nis a small constant (e.g.,\n10\n\n8\n) to avoid division by\nzero. A\nlow\nX\nk\nindicates that th e chunk offers minimal new\ninformation, whereas a\nhigh\nX\nk\nsuggests that\nC\nk\ncontains\ncontent that is distinct from what is already included.\nBayesian Update.\nTo dynamically adapt our acceptance\ncriterion, we model\nX\nk\nas a sample from a normal distri-\nbution\nN\n(\n ˙\n2\n)\n, treating\n(\n ˙\n2\n)\nas latent parameters that\nevolve with each observed\nX\nk\n. Let\n˝\n2\nobs\nbe the noise vari-\nance associated with the novelty measurement. Then after\nobserving\nX\nk\n, we update the posterior on\n(\n ˙\n)\nvia the\nstandard conjugate formulas:\n˙\n2\np ost\n=\n\u0010\n1\n˙\n2\n+\n1\n˝\n2\nobs\n\u0011\n\n1\n;\n(5)\n\np ost\n=\n˙\n2\np ost\n\u0010\n\n˙\n2\n+\nX\nk\n˝\n2\nobs\n\u0011\n:\n(6)\nThese updates allow us to re\u0002ne our expectation of h ow\nﬁnovelﬂ future chunks might be, based on previously ob-\nserved novelty scores.\nAdaptive Thresholding.\nOnce we have an updated poste-\nrior\n(\n ˙\n)\n, we de\u0002ne the acceptance threshold:\n\u0002 =\n\n+\n\u000b ˙;\n(7)\nwhere\n\u000b\nis a hyperparameter (e.g.,\n\u000b\n= 1\n:\n0\n). If\nX\nk\n\u0015\n\u0002\n, the\nk\n-th chunk is deemed suf\u0002ciently distinct and is\ntherefore\naccepted\n; otherwise, it is skipped. Importantly,\nthis threshold adapts over time: whenever we encounter\nmany high-novelty chunks in a row,\n\nand\n˙\nwill increase,\nthus raising the threshold and preventing trivial acceptance\nof slightly different chunks. Conversely, if\nX\nk\nvalues remain\nlow, the threshold may become easier to exceed, allowing\nmore chunks to be included.\nContext Vector Update.\nEach time a chunk\nC\nk\nis ac-\ncepted, we update\nv\nsel\nto account for the newly included\ninformation:\nv\nsel\n \nw\nk\nv\nsel\n+\n\n1\n\nw\nk\n\u0001\nh\nk\n; w\nk\n=\nX\nk\nX\nk\n+ 1\n:\n(8)\nIf\nX\nk\nis large (i.e., the chunk is very different from the\ncurrent context), we weight\nh\nk\nmore heavily, shifting\nv\nsel\ntoward new content.\nThrough this process, we compile a\nsubset\nof chunks that\ncollectively cover the salient information in the original\ndocument without redundant repetition. Denote this subset,\nin text form, by\nS\n.\n3.3. Generative Answer Construction\nAfter the Bayesian thresholding stage concludes, we con-\ncatenate the accepted chunks to form a \u0002nal context:\nC\n\fnal\n=\n\u0002\nC\ni\n1\nk C\ni\n2\nk \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 k C\ni\nm\n\u0003\n;\nwhere each\nC\ni\nj\n2 S\n:\n(9)\nThis context is then paired with a user query\nQ\nto produce\na prompt for a generative language model, such as BART.\nRather than providing the entire original documentŠwhich\nmay contain large swaths of duplicative textŠwe pass only\nthis \u0002ltered context, substantially reducing the token volume\nand enhancing both ef\u0002ciency and clarity.\nConstructing the Prompt.\nWe structure the prompt in a\nstraightforward, yet instructive manner, to guide the model\ntoward a concise answer. First, we indicate the system's\nrole (e.g., ﬁYou are a helpful QA systemﬂ), brie\u0003y restate\nthe user's query, then supply the relevant chunks under a\nﬁContext:ﬂ heading. Finally, we request a direct answer. For\nexample, in plain text:\nﬁYou are a helpful QA system. The user asks:\nf\nquestion\ng\n.\nBelow is relevant context \u0002ltered from a larger document:\nf\naccepted chunks\ng\nPlease provide the best possible answer.ﬂ\nThis format ensures that the generative model is aware of\nthe question and the most novel parts of the document, as\ndetermined by our Bayesian thresholding step.\n3.4.

Discussion and Rationale\nThis framework provides a balance between \u0002ne-grained\nchunking (which prevents losing local details) and an\nadaptive \u0002ltering mechanism (which curbs the exponential\ngrowth of repetitive or overlapping segments). Speci\u0002cally,\nthe\nBayesian thresholding\nensures that as soon as we ob-\nserve multiple chunks with similar content, our posterior\nmean\n\nincreases and makes the threshold\n\u0002\nmore strin-\ngent. Thus, we retain only chunks that truly introduce new\ninformation into the running context vector.\nFrom a computational perspective, our chunking strategy\nprocesses the document linearly, and each chunk embedding\ncan be computed in parallel batches if needed. The thresh-\nolding computations are negligible in overhead, involving\nonly a few arithmetic updates per chunk. Additionally, since\nwe feed the generative model only those chunks that sur-\npass the novelty threshold, our \u0002nal input size is drastically\nreduced compared to naive concatenation of all chunks.\nIn summary, this proposed method leverages simple yet\npowerful statistical reasoning to deal with large-scale QA\ntasks where full-document encoding is infeasible or prone to\nredundancy. The resulting prompt, which contains only the\nmost salient segments, allows generative language models\nlike BART to focus on truly relevant information, thereby\nimproving both ef\u0002ciency and accuracy in answer genera-\ntion.\n4. Experimental Setup\nWe evaluate our proposed methodsŠcollectively referred to\nas\nSEQA\n(short for\nStatisticalEstimationQA\n)Šon two QA\nbenchmarks that feature long or multi-paragraph contexts.\nBelow, we describe the datasets, the methods we compare,\nthe hyperparameters we employ in a\nnarrative\nfashion, and\nthe evaluation metrics and protocol used in our experiments.\n4.1. Datasets\nWe focus on two validation sets known to contain extraneous\ntext and thus require robust \u0002ltering or retrieval:\nHotpotQA (Distractor Split).\nEach question is paired\nwith multiple paragraphs, some of which are irrelevant dis-\ntractors. We adopt the validation set from the distractor\ncon\u0002guration, which requires multi-hop reasoning across\nthese paragraphs.\nTriviaQA (RC Split).\nFeatures extended snippets for each\nquery, often containing large amounts of irrelevant text. We\nagain use the validation set. Both of these datasets demon-\nstrate whether a system can effectively isolate and summa-\nrize relevant evidence in scenarios where input contexts can\nbe quite large.\n4.2. Methods Compared\nIn all methods, we ultimately generate answers through\nfacebook/bart-large\n. The methods differ primarily\nin how they retrieve, segment, or \u0002lter the input text:\nSEQA (Chunk-Only, Proposed).\nThis approach handles\na single long document (or an already-merged text) by split-\nting it into chunks of about 300 tokens each (with a 30-token\noverlap). A running context vector is maintained while em-\nbedding these chunks, and a Bayesian thresholding proce-\ndure decides whether each chunk is suf\u0002ciently novel or\nredundant. Only novel chunks are retained and combined\nwith the user's query, then fed into BART-Large for \u0002nal\nanswer generation.\nSEQA (With Index, Proposed).\nWhen multiple docu-\nments are available, or a large document collection is in-\nvolved, the system \u0002rst retrieves the top-\nk\npassages (com-\nmonly\nk\n= 3\n) via a vector-based retrieval mechanism (e.g.,\nFaiss). It then applies the same chunking and Bayesian\n\u0002ltering to eliminate overlapping or repetitive content, pre-\nserving only key segments. BART-Large subsequently uses\nthese segments as context.\nBart with Faiss Retrieval (Baseline).\nRetrieves top-\nk\npassages but does not perform chunk-level \u0002ltering. Instead,\nthe retrieved text is concatenated in full, along with the\n5\n",
    "page_6": "Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2025\nquery, before passing into BART-Large.\nBart with Memory Network (Baseline).\nSplits the text\n(or set of documents) into smaller fragments of around 128\ntokens each. A multi-hop retrieval mechanism then progres-\nsively collects relevant fragments based on an updated query\nrepresentation. Once a set of relevant fragments is gathered,\nBART-Large generates the answer.\nBart with Summarization (Baseline).\nGradually summa-\nrizes large blocks of text into more concise paragraphs. The\n\u0002nal condensed representation is merged with the question\nand provided as input to BART-Large.\nBart with DPR or Contriever (Baselines).\nRelies on\ndense retrieval encoders (either DPR or Contriever) to em-\nbed both queries and passages in a shared space. The top-\nk\npassages are retrieved according to similarity scores, then\ndirectly concatenated for BART-Large. No chunk-level nov-\nelty \u0002ltering is used in these pipelines.\n4.3. Hyperparameter Settings (Narrative)\nAll of our SEQA methods rely on a chunk size of roughly\n300 tokens, along with a 30-token overlap to ensure conti-\nnuity. For the Bayesian thresholding, we begin with a prior\nmean (\n\n0\n) of 0.5 and a prior standard deviation (\n˙\n0\n) of 0.1.\nWe also set an observation noise variance (\n˝\n2\nobs\n) to 0.05, re-\n\u0003ecting uncertainty in each chunk's measured novelty score.\nFinally, we include a margin coef\u0002 cient\n\u000b\n= 1\n:\n0\n, so that any\nchunk whose novelty score is below\n\n+\n\u000b ˙\nis considered\nredundant and therefore \u0002ltered out.\nFor methods that rely on vector indexing (Faiss retrieval,\nDPR, Contriever, and SEQA with Index), we retrieve the\ntop-\nk\npassages, typically setting\nk\n= 3\n. When dealing with\na single document or pre-merged text, SEQA (Chunk-Only)\nsimply splits it into chunks. Baseline methods, such as\nthe Memory Network, use smaller chunks (128 tokens) to\nstore data in a memory bank, whereas the Summarization\nbaseline works on paragraph-level blocks. In each case, the\nprocessed or \u0002ltered text (chunks, memory fragments, or\nsummaries) is then concatenated with the question for input\nto\nfacebook/bart-large\n, which runs beam search\n(beam size of 2 or 4) with a maximum generation length of\n128 tokens. We also impose an encoder input limit of 512\nor 1024 tokens, depending on resource availability, to avoid\nexceeding the BART model's capacity.\n4.4. Evaluation Metrics and Protocol\nSince the outputs are free-form and often rephrase the ref-\nerence answers, we employ four generative QA metrics:\nBERTScore\n(for semantic similarity),\nBLEU\nand\nROUGE-L\n(for various forms of lexical overlap), and\nPerplexity\n(com-\nputed by a small language model like GPT-Neo 125M to\ngauge \u0003uency). We do not rely on exact match or F1, be-\ncause their strict token-level matching tends to underesti-\nmate correctness in open-ended generation tasks.\nFor each question in the HotpotQA (distractor) and Triv-\niaQA (RC) validation sets, we run all methods with the\nsame BART-Large generator. We then compute the above\nmetrics by comparing the resulting answers to the provided\nreferences and take the average over the full validation split.\nThis consistent testing procedure ensures that we can di-\nrectly observe how effectively each pipeline navigates long\nor multi-document contexts, whether by chunking, retrieval,\nor summarization, and how well each maintains semantic\n\u0002delity and \u0003uency in its \u0002nal answers.\n5. Results and Discussion\nIn this section, we present the empirical outcomes of our\nproposed\nStatistical Estimation QA\nframework on two rep-\nresentative QA benchmarks,\nHotpotQA\nand\nTriviaQA\n. We\ncompare our method against four baselines:\nFusionInDe-\ncoder (FiD)\n(\nIzacard & Grave\n,\n 2021\n),\nRAG\n(\nLewis et al.\n,\n2020\n),\nMemoryNetwork\n(\nWeston et al.\n,\n 2015\n), and\nHierar-\nchicalSummarization\n(Section-based summarization). We\nreport results on both\ntraditional extractive\nmetrics (EM,\nF1) and\ngenerative\nmetrics (BLEU, ROUGE, Perplexity,\nBERTScore).

This phenomenon is not un-\nusual in\ngenerative QA\ntasks, where models often paraphrase\nthe original answer or produce newly synthesized sentences\ninstead of reproducing the exact ground-truth tokens. Con-\nsequently, small token-overlap metrics cannot adequately\ncapture the correctness of such free-form responses.\n6\n",
    "page_7": "Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2025\n(2) ROUGE Also Remains Low.\nSimilar to BLEU,\nROUGE primarily measures lexical overlap at the phrase\nor sequence level. Although FusionInDecoder's ROUGE\non HotpotQA is slightly above zero (\n˘\n0.0797), most other\nscores remain under 0.01, indicating minimal textual over-\nlap. This reinforces that the generated answers deviate\nsubstantially from any reference wording.\n(3) Large Variation in Perplexity (PPL).\nPerplexity, mea-\nsured via a separate GPT-2 model, spans values from about\n10\nto over\n4\n:\n0\n\u0002\n10\n7\nin the more extreme cases. Notably,\nRAG\non TriviaQA yields an exceptionally high PPL of\n4\n:\n0\n\u0002\n10\n7\n, suggesting that the GPT-2 language model \u0002nds\ncertain RAG outputs highly unnatural or out of distribution.\nOn the other hand, MemoryNetwork in HotpotQA obtains\naround 10.7 PPL, likely due to short or repetitive outputs\nperceived as more ﬁpredictableﬂ by GPT-2.\n(4) BERTScore Re\u0003ects Meaningful Content Similarity.\nDespite vanishingly small token-level overlaps, BERTScore\nvalues range from\n0\n:\n75\nto\n0\n:\n81\n, con\u0002rming that the model\noutputs convey semantically related content to the reference.\nFor instance, StatisticalEstimationQA achieves\n0\n:\n787\n(Hot-\npotQA) and\n0\n:\n796\n(TriviaQA), illustrating that it preserves\nessential meaning better than the lexical overlap might sug-\ngest. One outlier is HierarchicalSummarization on Hot-\npotQA, which yields a BERTScore of\n0\n:\n0\n, implying it might\nproduce context-irrelevant or empty answers.\n(5) Proposed Method (StatisticalEstimationQA).\nOur ap-\nproach demonstrates comparatively robust performance re-\ngarding BERTScore (\nˇ\n0\n:\n79\n˘\n0\n:\n80\n). In generative QA,\nsuch semantic-based metrics are more informative than\nsurface-level overlaps. Moreover, the slight improvement in\nBERTScore over FusionInDecoder or RAG supports our ar-\ngument that\nAdaptive Chunk Sizing\nand\nBayesian thresh-\nolding\nhelp preserve critical information from the original\ndocument without in\u0003ating the model's input window or\nproducing extraneous text. Nonetheless, we observe a rela-\ntively high PPL on HotpotQA (\n˘\n294\n), indicating that the\nGPT-2 model \u0002nds some of our outputs more linguistically\ndiverse or unpredictable.\nQualitative Analysis.\nA manual inspection of several\nsampled outputs reveals that our StatisticalEstimationQA\nfrequently produces coherent multi-sentence answers that\nrephrase or condense the original references. While meth-\nods like RAG or MemoryNetwork occasionally yield shorter\nor incomplete statements, their BERTScore remains com-\npetitive, suggesting that they do capture essential facts in\nsome form. However, RAG's extremely high PPL on Trivi-\naQA underlines the instability of purely retrieval-augmented\napproaches when encountering noisy or domain-speci\u0002c\nqueries.\nOverall, these \u0002ndings highlight the inadequacy of\nextractive-based metrics for free-form QA, while simulta-\nneously emphasizing the value of semantic-level evaluation\nmeasures (BERTScore, perplexity) in diagnosing generative\nmodels' behaviors.\n6. Conclusion\nWe introduced a\nstatistical estimation\nframework to ad-\ndress large-scale Question Answering under constrained\ncontext windows. By integrating\nAdaptive Chunk Sizing\n(to\nprevent unwieldy fragmentation) and\nBayesian thresholding\n(to prune redundant chunks), our method constructs a con-\ncise yet representative context embedding for documents\nthat exceed typical LLM input limits. While chunk selec-\ntion is biased rather than random, we leveraged a\nCLT-based\napproximation\nto fuse selected embeddings, resulting in a\nsingle vector that captures essential document semantics.\nEmpirical results on\nHotpotQA\nand\nTriviaQA\nunderscore\nthe dif\u0002culty of evaluating generative QA models using\ntoken-level overlaps (EM, F1, BLEU, ROUGE), which all\nremained near zero. In contrast,\nBERTScore\nvalues demon-\nstrate that the generated answers do convey semantically\nrelevant information, even if they diverge lexically from\nthe reference. Furthermore, although our method does not\nimprove upon extractive scores, it yields\ncompetitive or su-\nperior\nBERTScore compared to baselines such as FiD, RAG,\nor MemoryNetwork, re\u0003ecting its effectiveness in retaining\nessential document content under restricted context length.\nNevertheless, perplexity analysis reveals that certain QA\noutputs can appear irregular or ill-formed to a pretrained\nlanguage model (e.g., GPT-2), particularly in retrieval-\naugmented or memory-based systems. For real-world de-\nployment, we envision\nhybrid approaches\nthat combine\nadaptive chunk selection with more robust answer gener-\nation, possibly with domain-speci\u0002c \u0002ne-tuning to reduce\nlinguistic mismatch.\nIn future work, we plan to:\nŁ\nExtend the statistical chunk selection mechanism to\nmulti-document\nscenarios and continually updating\ndata streams, enabling scalable QA beyond a single\nsource.\nŁ\nExplore more\n\u0002ne-grained Bayesian\nmodels that diff er-\nentiate chunk-level novelty from domain shifts, further\nre\u0002ning acceptance thresholds.\nŁ\nIntegrate\nretrieval-augmented\ngeneration techniques\nwith our CLT-based method to mitigate the extreme per-\nplexity spikes observed in certain retrieval pipelines.\nWe hope this line of research encourages broader adoption\nof\ngenerative QA metrics\nand emphasizes the importance\n7\n",
