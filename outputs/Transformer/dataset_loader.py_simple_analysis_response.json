This module is responsible for bringing raw text data (from both WMT and WSJ sources) into the training pipeline by reading files, tokenizing text with Hugging Face tokenizers, building vocabularies, splitting the data into training/dev/test sets, and finally grouping the tokenized sequences into batches based on an approximate token count (from the configuration). Note that all configuration settings are read from config.py (which imports config.yaml) and common helper functions (e.g., file I/O, logging, tokenizer wrappers, and batch construction) are imported from utils.py.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Overview of dataset_loader.py \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. Import Configuration and Utilities  \n\u2003\u2022 Import the centralized configuration (e.g., training parameters, model sizes, data parameters) from config.py.  \n\u2003\u2022 Also import any helper functions (such as logging, file reading, and tokenization helper functions) from utils.py.\n\n2. Class Definition: DatasetLoader  \n\u2003\u2022 The DatasetLoader class will be initialized with the configuration dictionary.  \n\u2003\u2022 Its role:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Read raw text from file paths (for example, for WMT translations and WSJ parsing tasks).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Based on the task (machine translation or constituency parsing), decide which raw files to load.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For translation tasks, load paired data:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 One file for the source language and one file for the target language.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 (For example, using \u201cwmt_2014_en_de\u201d settings: using BPE with vocab size 37000, or \u201cwmt_2014_en_fr\u201d using wordpiece with vocab size 32000.)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For parsing tasks, load raw sentences (and possibly tree representations) from the WSJ dataset (or the semi-supervised version).\n\n3. Tokenization Pipeline  \n\u2003\u2022 Determine which tokenizer to use:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Access the configuration (config.data.*) to choose between BPE or WordPiece.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Use Hugging Face\u2019s tokenizers (or sentencepiece, depending on the file) to either load a pretrained tokenizer or to train a new one on the training data.\n\u2003\u2022 Vocabulary Building:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For translation tasks, if share_embedding is true (as specified in config.model.share_embedding), ensure that the same tokenizer/vocabulary is used for both source and target.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The vocabulary size should be set to the value given in the configuration (e.g., 37000 for wmt_2014_en_de).\n\u2003\u2022 Tokenize each sentence (or each sentence pair) into a list of token IDs.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Call the tokenizer\u2019s encode function on each sentence.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Optionally, add special tokens such as start-of-sentence and end-of-sentence markers if required.\n\u2003\u2022 Log key information (using utilities) such as vocabulary size and number of tokens processed.\n\n4. Splitting into Training, Validation, and Test Sets  \n\u2003\u2022 After reading and tokenizing the full dataset, split the data into three sets.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For the WMT translation experiments, follow common conventions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use the majority of the data for training.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Designate known development sets (e.g., newstest2013) as the dev set and separate newstest2014 as the test set.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For the WSJ parsing experiments:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use the provided 40K sentences of WSJ for training and set aside a development and test split (typically WSJ Section 23 for evaluation).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If using semi-supervised data, merge or create a separate split as needed.\n\u2003\u2022 Document any assumptions or delimiters if explicit file splits are not provided in the config.\n\n5. Batch Construction Based on Token Count  \n\u2003\u2022 The configuration (config.training.batch_tokens) defines approximately how many source tokens (and target tokens) should be present in a batch.\n\u2003\u2022 For each dataset split:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For translation, iterate over the list of tokenized sentence pairs.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 For each sentence (or sentence pair), count the tokens. Accumulate sentences until the total count (of source tokens and similarly target tokens) reaches or is close to the configured batch token limit.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Wrap the batch data into a dictionary (or a similar structure) that holds the tokenized sequences (with possible padding) along with any necessary metadata (like sequence lengths).\n\u2003\u2022 For parsing tasks, perform a similar batching strategy on the tokenized sentences (and tree-linearized sequences if applicable).  \n\u2003\u2022 Log batch information (e.g., number of batches, average tokens per batch) to help with debugging and reproducibility.\n\n6. Handling Edge Cases and Extensions  \n\u2003\u2022 As the file format of the dataset may vary, include error handling when reading or tokenizing files.  \n\u2003\u2022 For constituency parsing, note that the method to linearize trees into sequences is not defined by the paper. In this module, leave placeholders or configurable options that allow future specification of the linearization strategy (e.g., bracket-based encoding).  \n\u2003\u2022 Allow for switching between different datasets (WMT vs. WSJ) based on configuration parameters.\n\u2003\u2022 Ensure that once the data is tokenized and batched, it is returned in a format that is compatible with subsequent modules (e.g., Trainer expects a Dataset object that yields dictionaries with token IDs).\n\n7. Returned Data Structure  \n\u2003\u2022 The load_data() method should return a tuple: (train_data, dev_data, test_data).  \n\u2003\u2022 Each element in the tuple should be in a format that the Trainer class and Evaluation class expect (for example, a list of batch dictionaries or an object with a __getitem__ method).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Summary of Key Points \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Initialize DatasetLoader with configuration from config.py and import helper methods from utils.py.\n\u2022 For each dataset (translation and parsing):\n\u2003\u2013 Read the raw text data from files (file paths might be provided via additional configuration or assumed defaults).\n\u2003\u2013 Choose and configure the Hugging Face tokenizer (BPE for wmt_2014_en_de, wordpiece for wmt_2014_en_fr, etc.) and build the vocabulary with sizes specified (37000, 32000, etc.).\n\u2003\u2013 Tokenize each sentence (or sentence pair), adding special tokens as needed.\n\u2003\u2013 Split the tokenized examples into training, development, and test sets with known conventions (e.g., using newstest2013 for dev and newstest2014 for test in MT experiments; WSJ splits in parsing).\n\u2003\u2013 Construct batches where the total number of tokens approximates config.training.batch_tokens, ensuring that each batch is a dictionary containing the tokenized sequences (and possibly their lengths or masks).\n\u2022 Embed logging and error handling to keep track of progress when processing large datasets.\n\u2022 Note areas needing clarification (such as the explicit method for tree linearization in parsing and exact file path formats).\n\nThis analysis should serve as a complete blueprint for coding dataset_loader.py such that the data loading, tokenization, vocabulary building, splitting, and batching all adhere strictly to the experimental methodology of the Transformer paper and the design details specified in the configuration file.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1746665497, "model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8b28473bdb", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 3340, "prompt_tokens": 16225, "total_tokens": 19565, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 1856, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}]
